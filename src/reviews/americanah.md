## thoughts:

‘Americanah’ is an interesting novel. it took me over a year to read mainly because it was a physical copy that I only read on travel journeys. but i finally decided to finish in the summer of ‘25.  

there are some novel aspects I found thought-provoking in this book. the concept of the non-american black is one I do not think was heavily discussed pre-this-book and was refreshing at times to read. her bubble in America, and the zed’s bubble in the uk and nigeria, was interesting to explore. the parallels of these two characters living out a version of the ‘african dream’ and ending up in the same place is in a way, *poetic*. 

the zed’s obsession with america until he finally has enough money to visit and realizes its lack-lustreness is very telling. 

he knocks on the door of opportunity in the UK and everywhere else. in fact, it isn’t until it the door is rudely shut in his face that he ‘decides’(life decides for him) to walk down the nigerian path. I believe this is a nod to the idea that Nigeria is a rich man’s country, as contradictory as it sounds. he lives a comfortable life there and with all his wealth he is no longer chasing that dream of living abroad or sending his kids to school abroad etc. this is the same character who was obsessed with the american culture. in the book he defines this mindset shift as ‘growing up’ but leaves out the part about getting rich. to purposefully want stay in a developing country such as nigeria, you must be as rich and well connected as the zed or be a been-to like Ifem.

speaking of, ifem’s character is flawed and sometimes very unlikeable. she is a highly judgemental and hypocritical person but the story seems to force the reader to like her. moments like her fight with blaine about not showing up for the protest or her calling the zed a coward come to mind. she comes across as condescending in a lot of situations but the passive reader is made to feel it is okay because she does it in a ‘self-conscious’ way, almost ironic even. but this falls flat to me. especially in her return to Nigeria. sometimes it seems she wants to be contrarian just because. perhaps that is a commentary on people in general. 

the story—*to me*—does not carry a whole lot to latch onto but there definitely are some moments of brilliance.
examples of this come from how well represented the topic of race is, and the flair of adding Nigerian vernacular to formal writing. I think characters can be just as important of a vessel in conveying a message as the plot is, and in a way that was missing for me. a lot of the social commentary came through the blog posts and the excerpts from ifem’s life were more condescending than informative, especially in the later chapters. In a way that makes it a little lazy but in the same vein also a little bit brilliant. i’m not going as low as to compare it to a self help book but there is a similarity in a way the teachings are expressed in the most blunt, distilled forms possible.
